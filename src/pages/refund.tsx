            INSPIRANTE TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED believes in helping its
            customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation
            policy. Under this policy:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc px-0 md:px-10 text-sm md:text-lg">
            <li>
              Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made
              immediately after placing the order. However, the cancellation
              request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated
              to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of
              shipping them.
            </li>
            <li>
              INSPIRANTE TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED does not accept cancellation
              requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables etc. However,
              refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the
              quality of product delivered is not good.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the
              same to our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be
              entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at
              his own end. This should be reported within 7 days of receipt of the
              products.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case you feel that the product received is not as shown on the
              site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of
              our customer service within 7 days of receiving the product. The
              Customer Service Team after looking into your complaint will take an
              appropriate decision.

              In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty
